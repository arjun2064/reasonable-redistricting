Very well-written proposal. This looks like a very interesting project idea, and I am looking forward to see your results.

**Dataset**

- Start thinking about how specifically are you gonna construct the graph. In what kind of strcuture are you gonna store nodes? How about edges? Also, what kind of storing structure allowa easy check on whether the given two nodes are connected? 

**Algorithm**

- Normally, we do not allow constant or random edge weights for covered algorthmns, but it seems your third algorthm requires random weight. So here is what we gonna do: if you were able to implement both your second and third algorithms successfully, I will let you to use random egde weights on your second and third algorithmns (idealy, use some meaningful weights if possible). But, if you were not able to finish your third algorthm at the end(say you run out of time or have a major bug), you will have to use meaningful edge weights for your second algorithm for partial credits.
