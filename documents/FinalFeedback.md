    Great presentation! It was very thorough and imformative, and I really enjoyed watching it. The video is a bit longer than the requirement, but given that the problem and algorithms are somewhat more complicated, so I won't take points off because of that.

    Very nice README file! It was impressive that you clearly mentioned the working environment. The step by step instructions on command lines are also very user-friendly. One monior suggestion is that you can add more explains on code organization section, such as the location for essential functions.

    Great project overall! The code base was well orgnaized(but I would suggest put all files in a folder to make git repo more clean). It was impressive that you applied what you learned from this class to a real world problem, and did your own researchs on solutions.
