### Week March18 ~ April 3

PASS

Nice work. Just an suggestion, you may want to consider organize your git repo a little, since there will be points on the organization of your code at final delivery.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS (improvement on dev log is needed)

Nice work. You guys should be on the right track. For the mid-checkin, remember to write test cases for your data parsing and traversal functions. Try to use some small dataset/graphs to verify your implementations. Also, please try to elaborate on your weekly progress in your dev log next week. Other than that, I am looking forward to see your results.

### Week April 11 ~ April 17

PASS

Nice work. Remember to write test cases for both BFS and data parsing. Other than that, I will see you at the mid-checkin.

### Week April 18 - April 24

PASS

Nice work. Good job on the mid-checkin.

### Week April 25 - May 1

PASS

Good job! Couple reminders for the final delivery:
- READ THE RUBRIC VERY CAREFULLY! (I am more than willing to give partial credits, but I cannot give out points that are clearly missing based on the rubric)
- In README, Make sure to mention how to run, compile, and test your code, and also where are all the files
- In write up, remember to decripe your algorithms' input/ouput, and problem solved by your algorithms. Explain the runtime of your algorithms.
- For your code, make sure your code can compile and run. There should be comments throught the code, and not junk codes.
- For the presentation, discuss your goal, method used, and individuals' conclusion thoughs. A powerpoint will be nice.
