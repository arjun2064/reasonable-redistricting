# Team Contract
## Communication 
### Team Meetings
The team will meet on Wednesdays after labs, at 5pm. Meetings are expected to last 1 hour. If a team member is unable to make the lab, they should let the rest of the team know 24 hours beforehand so the rest of the team can get them up to date. During meetings, we will go over what we have accomplished in the prior weeks, as well as what we plan to implement in the future. Development logs will also be completed.
### Assistance
Discord will function as the team's primary means of communicating when out of meetings. It is expected members respond within a 24 hours time frame. Members are expected to complete their portion of the workload, but exceptions may be made if there are unresolvable difficulties that come up.
### Respect
Team members will create a safe learning environment where others can freely ask questions and learn. There should be no circumstances in which teammates feel uncomfortable with their role.
## Collaboration 
### Work Distribution
Tentatively, we have arranged the following work distribution -
#### - Barnett: Project Managing & Implementation
#### - Harry: Algorithm Design & Implementation
#### - Hao: Implementation & Miscellaneous
In case a team member is unable to complete their portion of the project, they may seek assistance from team members within reason.
### Time Commitment
Each member of the team is expected to commit around 10 hours per week on the project. If time conflicts occur, this should be addressed in either meetings or in Discord to let other members know beforehand.
### Conflict Resolution
Members of the team should strive to be as transparent as possible with each other in order to minimize any conflicts that may occur. This can vary anywhere from being unable to make a meeting or having an issue with a portion of the code. Each member of the team should seek to de-escalate conflicts should they come up and refocus the team to progress at the tasks at hand. Late members will be shamed by having the `Late` flair in Discord for 1 week.
